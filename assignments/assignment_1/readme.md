# Assignment 1: Basic Scripting with Python
## Description
This was the first assignment in Language Analytics. In this assignment we were working the corpus of 100 novels with which we had to create a dataframe consisting of the name of the novels as well as the total word count and the number of unique words.  

## Running it
For this assignment the corpus are in the data and after git cloning this repository it will be possible to run the bash script: "run_script" and a csv file will be saved in the output folder. For now a duplicate of the output is saved as an example file to show the end product of this assignment.
