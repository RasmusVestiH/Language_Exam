# Assignment 1: Basic Scripting with Python
## Description

This was the first assignment in Language Analytics. In this assignment we were working the corpus of 100 novels with which we had to create a dataframe consisting of the name of the novels as well as the total word count and the number of unique words. 

The purpose for this assignment was to understand the basic concepts of working in python and creating a table based on data in which used for-loops and append functions as well as pandas to_csv function to save a dataframe as a csv file.   


## Running it

For this assignment the corpus are in the data and after git cloning this repository it will be possible to run the bash script: "run_script" and a csv file will be saved in the output folder. For now a duplicate of the output is saved as an example file to show the end product of this assignment.
